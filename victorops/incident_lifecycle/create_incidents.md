# Create Incidents

## 1. On-Call

Before generating any incidents you should assign yourself to the current Shift within your **Follow the Sun Support - Business Hours** Rotation and also place yourself **On-Call**.

* Click on the **Schedule** link within your **Team** in the **People** section on the left
* Or navigate to **Teams → [Your Team] → Rotations**
* Expand the **Follow the Sun Support - Business Hours** Rotation
* Click on the **Manage members** icon (the figures) for the current active shift depending on your timezone

* Use the **Select a user to add...** dropdown to add yourself to the shift
* Then click on **Set Current** to make yourself the current **on-call** user within the shift
* You should now get a **Push Notification** to your phone informing you that **You Are Now On-Call**

## 2. Trigger Alert

Switch back to your shell session connected to your EC2 Instance or Multipass VM, all of the following commands will be executed from your VM:

Force the CPU to spike to 100% by running the following command:

=== "Shell Command"

    ```
    openssl speed -multi $(grep -ci processor /proc/cpuinfo)
    ```

    ```

    +R:8262960:md4:3.000000
    +DT:md4:3:1024
    ```

This will result in an Alert being generated by SignalFx which in turn will generate an Incident within VictorOps within a maximum of 10 seconds.

This is the default polling time for the SignalFx Agent we installed (note it can optionally be reduced to 1 second).
