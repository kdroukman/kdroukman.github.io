# Initial Setup

## Aim

This module is simply to ensure you have access to both the VictorOps and SignalFx UIs which we will be using throughout this workshop.

Once you have access to each platform, keep them open for the duration of the workshop as you will be switching between them and the workshop instructions.

## 1. Activate your VictorOps Login

You should have received an invitation to Activate your VictorOps account via e-mail, if you have not already done so, click the _Activate Account_ link and follow the prompts.

If you did not receive an invitation it is probably because you already have a VictorOps login, linked to a different organisation.

If so login to to that Org, then use the organisation dropdown next to your username in the top left to switch to the Observability Workshop EMEA Org.

!!! Note
If you do not see the Organisation dropdown menu item next to your name with Observability Workshop EMEA that is OK, it simply means you only have access to a single Org so that menu is not visible to you.

If you have forgotten your password go to the sign-in page and use the forgotten password link to reset your password.

## 2. Activate your SignalFx Login

You should have received an invitation to join the Observability Workshop on SignalFx.  If you have not already done so click the **JOIN NOW**{: .label-button .sfx-ui-button-blue} button and follow the prompts to set a password and activate your login.
