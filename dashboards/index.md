If you are already receiving metrics through a Cloud API integration or the Smart Agent you will see relevant dashboards for these services in SignalFx.

Among the dashboards you will see a Dashboard group called **Sample Data**. This group exists by default in all SignalFx accounts. Let's take a closer look at it.
