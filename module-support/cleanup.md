# Post Workshop Clean Up

=== "Multipass"

    Once you have finished with this Workshop `exit` from the Multipass instance to get back to your system command prompt.
    
    Enter the following to delete and purge the Multipass instance:

    ```text
    multipass delete --purge ${INSTANCE}
    ```

=== "AWS/EC2"

    Once you have finished with this Workshop `exit` from the AWS/EC2 instance to get back to your system command prompt.
    
    We will use Terraform to destroy the instance with the parameters you used in [Smart Agent](../../smartagent/prep/) module:

    ```text
    cd ~/workshop/ec2
    terraform destroy -var="aws_instance_count=1" -var="instance_type=1"
    ```

    Enter `Instance Count`, `Provide the desired region` and `Select instance type required`.
    
    When prompted type `yes` to confirm you want to destroy, this will take a while to complete.

    ```text
